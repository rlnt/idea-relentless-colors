## **üìë Overview**

This is a color scheme for all common [JetBrains] IDEs. It features vibrant and contrasting colors to give you the best possible coding experience.

The carefully chosen colors harmonise perfectly with a dark theme. It's perfect for night owls.

## **üî® Prerequisites**

**Relentless-Colors** is only a color scheme. Therefore it is recommended to install an IDE theme before.

A lot of good themes can be found [here][color themes]. Just pick your preferred one but keep in mind that **Relentless-Colors** is recommended to be used with a dark theme.

My personal recommendation is the *Material Darker Contrast* theme which is a part of [Material Theme UI Lite][material theme].

The color scheme also comes with a recommended font. [Fira Code] is the perfect coding font with its awesome font ligatures. You should install it before you install the scheme.

There is also a recommended font for the console. **Relentless-Colors** uses [MesloLGS NF] for that. Make sure that you have it before you install the scheme.


## **üîß Installation**

Installation from [Marketplace] (*recommended*):

1. Start your preffered [JetBrains] IDE and go to plugins.
2. Search for **Relentless-Colors** and install it.
3. Restart your IDE.
4. Go to the settings and navigate to *Editor > Color Scheme*.
5. Select **Relentless-Colors**.
6. Hit **Apply** and **OK**.

Manual installation:

1. Download the latest **jar-file** from the [releases].
2. Start your preferred [JetBrains] IDE and go to the settings.
3. Navigate to *Editor > Color Scheme*.
4. Click the three dots at the top and hit **Import Scheme...**.
5. Navigate to the downloaded *Relentless-Colors.jar* and hit **OK**.
6. Hit **Apply** and **OK**. An IDE restart may be required.


## **üìï History**

Unfortunately, I'm a perfectionist. This is often reflected in my code and at my workplace.

The IDEs of [JetBrains] are ingenious but unfortunately I never found the right color scheme for me which would have made my programming experience perfect so I decided to create my own palette.

Since I am aware that many programmers are looking to improve their coding environment and customize it, I thought I would make my colors available to everyone.
